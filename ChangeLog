v3.0: 1999-08-20

  - Added two new font encodings for the Neep font family:
  
      ISO8859-9  (Latin5, Western European + Turkish)
      ISO8859-15 (Latin9, Western European + Euro Symbol)

  - Added a NEWS file, and moved the change history into its own
    separate ChangeLog file.

  - Quite a few X applications (notably Gimp and Netscape) pay no
    attention whatsoever to the ADD_STYLE font field.  I consider that
    broken behavior.  Unfortunately, to work around that, i've had to
    abandon use of the ADD_STYLE field to indicate the font variants
    with alternate ampersand glyphs.  Now, the regular variants have a
    FAMILY_NAME of `Neep', and the alternate variants have a
    FAMILY_NAME of `Neep Alt'.  See the NEWS file for info on dealing
    with this change.

  - Back in version 1.3, i changed the shape of the Neep-18 fonts from
    a round shape to a relatively square one, chiefly because the bold
    font looked ... well, they looked bad.  I have since discovered how
    to make them look good.  :)  Hence, they are back to a (now
    significantly more legible) round shape.  Now i'm even willing to
    use them.  :)

  - As a result of the item above, i also improved the bold weights of
    the Neep-24 fonts and the Neep-9 fonts and both the regular and
    bold weights of the Neep-14 fonts (i think these in particular look
    much better).  Also made the shapes and centering of some glyphs
    consistent across all sizes and weights of the Neep family.

  - Removed the `13-point' (6x14) variants from the Neep family (the
    ones with increased height for diacritical marks).  I didn't get
    enough positive feedback about them, and i was tired of maintaining
    two complete variants of the same font that were nearly alike.  See
    the NEWS file for more info.

  - The last release left out entries in fonts.alias for the neep-9
    fonts.  Added them.  Thanks to Edgar Toernig <froese@gmx.de> for
    pointing that out.

v2.1: 1999-06-12

  - Added 8-point (5x10) Neep font; now Neep can get even smaller.

  - Added bold variant of neep-9 (5x11).  It's tough to properly do
    boldface that small, but here's an attempt.  I'm not particularly
    satisfied with it yet, but it's worth releasing.

  - Tweaked glyphs in neep-9, partly due to the new bold variant.

  - Added a `13-point' (6x14) set of Neep variants; this set gives
    diacritical marks a bit more vertical space than the 6x13 font, so
    that accented capital letters can extend closer to their full
    height.  As a result, though, it also takes more vertical space in
    general. This is an experimental font; feedback would be
    appreciated.

  - Added a set of 10-point (6x11) Modd fonts.

  - Put Modd parts into a directory structure similar to that of Neep,
    in preparation for more font encodings.  As a result, the filenames
    of Modd fonts have changed.  Be sure you move the old `jmk' font
    directory out of the way before installing, otherwise you'll end up
    with conflicting fonts.

v2.0: 1999-01-20

  - Added ISO-8859-2 (Latin2) fonts.  Changed fonts.alias so that the
    ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) fonts are called, e.g.,
    `neep-iso8859-1-bold-12' instead of `neep-bold-12'.  `neep-bold-12'
    is, by default, an alias for `neep-iso8859-1-bold-12'; by editing
    fonts.alias before installing, you can make `neep-bold-12' point to
    `neep-iso8859-2-bold-12' to use the ISO-8859-2 fonts by default, if
    you use font aliases.
  
  - `NouveauGothic' has disappeared from fonts.alias, as a direct
    result of the above.  If you want NouveauGothic aliases, you'll
    have to maintain them yourself.

  - Very minor tweaks to some characters.  Specificially: improvements
    to characters with a cedilla in almost all sizes of Neep;
    improvements to characters with a tilde in Neep-12 and
    Neep-Bold-12.

v1.3: 1998-12-22

  - Changed the name of NouveauGothic to `Neep'.  I intended the font
    to be mostly practical (i.e., compact but legible), but with some
    aesthetic value.  `NouveauGothic' is just too damn long a name to
    be considered practical---four letters is much more practical.
    And, according to my (printed) edition of Webster's New Collegiate
    Dictionary:
    
        neep, n. < Anglo-Saxon `næp'; (Scot. and Dial.) A turnip.

    What could be more practical than a turnip?
    
    NOTE:  If you install the `fonts.alias' file, the old names will
    still work.  They'll be phased out in a later release.

    NOTE ALSO:  If you have a prior version of jmk-x11-fonts, you should
    probably move the `jmk' font directory out of the way before
    installing this version.  If you don't do so, you're likely to
    create a bit of a mess.  If you upgrade using an RPM, you're in
    good shape (it's one good reason to use packages like RPMs).

  - Radically changed the shape of Neep-18 (the 10x20 font).  The
    shape was too round and created jaggies on some characters.  The
    new shape is more square, and i think it's more legible.
    Constructive comments are welcome on this.

  - Tweaked glyphs in Neep-9 (the 5x11 font).  Some glyphs weren't
    properly centered in the character cell, and some accented
    characters didn't have the proper shape.

  - Tweaked a few glyphs in Modd and Modd-Bold; the accented `i' glyphs
    still had an old serif on them.

  - Still only ISO-8859-1 encoding.  Sorry ... i was in West Africa for
    five weeks.  Next time.

v1.2: 1998-10-13

  - Added alternate set of NouveauGothic fonts which have a more
    traditionally-shaped ampersand (&) character, for those who prefer
    it.  The alternate fonts are installed alongside the regular ones
    and are available via font aliases as, for example,
    `nouveau-gothic-alt-12' or `nouveau-gothic-alt-bold-24'.  Thanks to
    Alain Empain <alemp@br.fgov.be> for pointing out that folks don't
    have the same typographical conventions everywhere.

  - Changed the filenames of the 5x11, 6x11, 6x13, and 8x15 fonts to
    use two digits in the XxY part of the filename (for example,
    `nouveau-gothic-05x11.bdf') so that filenames sort properly without
    user intervention.  This is something i should have done from the
    beginning.  This change will probably require that you either move
    the old font directory out of the way or remove it completely
    before installing the new fonts.  Note that this change does *not*
    affect the actual X11 font names, only the font filenames.

  - Radically restructured the way the NouveauGothic fonts are built in
    preparation for multiple font encodings down the road.

v1.1: 1998-09-16

  - Added Modd font family.
  
  - Added two new sizes to NouveauGothic: extra small (5x11 medium
    weight only) and huge (12x24).

  - Added tick marks to zero ('0') characters in medium weights of most
    NouveauGothic sizes, to aid in differentiating from capital 'O'
    characters.  Some bold weights (as well as the 5x11 medium weight)
    don't have enough room for tick marks.

v1.0.1: 1998-09-06

    Fixed bug in nouveau-gothic-6x11.bdf where characters 251 and 252
    were 1 pixel below the baseline.  Thanks to Edgar Toernig
    <froese@gmx.de>.

v1.0: 1998-08-31

    Initial release.
