| Version 3.0 (1999-Aug-20) |
+---------------------------+

  1. `AltGlyph' ADD_STYLE changes to +` Alt' in FAMILY_NAME.

  Quite a few X applications (notably Gimp and Netscape) pay no
  attention whatsoever to the ADD_STYLE font field.  I consider that
  broken behavior.  Unfortunately, to work around that, i've had to
  abandon use of the ADD_STYLE field to indicate the font variants with
  alternate ampersand glyphs.  With version 3.0, the regular variants
  have a FAMILY_NAME of `Neep', and the alternate variants have a
  FAMILY_NAME of `Neep Alt'.

  Unfortunately, this means a slightly incompatible change for folks
  who use the alternate variants.  Sorry about that; complain to the
  folks who write broken applications that don't handle the ADD_STYLE
  field.

  The OLD name for the Neep font variants with alternate glyphs is (for
  example):

    -jmk-Neep-Medium-R-*-AltGlyph-*-120-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-1
                       /^^^^^^^^^^
                [This goes away ...]

  The NEW name for the same font is:

    -jmk-Neep Alt-Medium-R-*--*-120-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-1
             ^^^^\
                [... and this appears in its place.]

  (Remember that X11 font names are not case sensitive.)


  How This Change Affects Installation
  ------------------------------------

  If you are installing on top of a previous release of jmk-x11-fonts,
  you need to follow step [3a] of the installation instructions
  (reproduced here):

    : (3a) If you're upgrading from a prior release, move the old `jmk'
    :      font directory out of the way before installing:
    :      
    :         mv FONTDIR/jmk/ FONTDIR/jmk.old/
    : 
    :     (where FONTDIR is the directory under which you installed the
    :     prior release of these fonts).

  Bad things may happen to you if you don't do this.
    

  How This Change Affects the User
  --------------------------------

  Once you have properly installed jmk-x11-fonts, this change should
  only affect you if you satisfy the following conditions:

  (1) You use the Neep font variants containting the alternate
      ampersand (`&') glyphs; AND

  (2a) You use the full X11 font name to refer to the fonts instead of
       using the aliases provided in the fonts.alias file included with
       the jmk-x11-fonts package;

       OR

  (2b) You use the aliases from fonts.alias which include the encoding
       (for example, `neep-iso8859-1-alt-12') instead of the ones that
       don't (`neep-alt-12').

  If you use the full font names to refer to the Neep fonts, simply
  change the font references as shown above.

  If you use the longer aliases to refer to the Neep fonts, you'll need
  to change the alias names slightly.

  The OLD aliases for the Neep font variants with alternate glyhps is
  (for example):

    neep-iso8859-2-alt-bold-14
                 /^^^^
            [This ...]
	
    neep-alt-iso8859-2-bold-14
        ^^^^\
            [... moves over here.]

  I highly recommend setting up the shorter aliases to point to the
  encodings you use most frequently in the fonts.alias file before
  installing.  Doing so will avoid such name-changing problems in the
  future.
  
  
  2. Experimental `13-point' size leaves Neep family.

  With release 3.0, the pseudo-13-point (6x14) size of the Neep font
  family ends its short life.  This is the one that looks almost just
  like the 12-point size, but with slightly increased room for
  diacritical marks.  I didn't receive enough positive feedback about
  this font to warrant the effort of maintaining it; it's significantly
  more trouble to maintain a font size that's very similar to another
  font size than it is to maintain one that's markedly different.

  If you liked and used the 13-point size, this change will affect you.
  You can continue using that size in all its encodings, but you may
  need to add it to the font directory and to the fonts.alias file by
  hand after installing new releases of jmk-x11-fonts.  If you really
  really want to continue using it, you might find it easier to put all
  of the 13-point encodings into a separate font directory, with its
  own fonts.alias and fonts.dir files.
