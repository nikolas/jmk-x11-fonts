These are character-cell fonts for use with the X Window System,
created by Jim Knoble.  The current list of fonts included in this
package are:

  Neep (formerly known as NouveauGothic)

    A pleasantly legible variation on the standard fixed fonts that
    accompany most distributions of the X Window System.  Comes in both
    normal and bold weights in small, medium, large, extra-large, and
    huge sizes, as well as an extra-small size that only comes in
    normal weight.  Comes in the following encodings:

      ISO-8859-1  (Latin1, Western European + Icelandic)
      ISO-8859-2  (Latin2, Eastern European)
      ISO-8859-9  (Latin5, Western European + Turkish)
      ISO-8859-15 (Latin9, Western European + Euro Symbol)

  Modd

    A fixed-width font with sleek, contemporary styling.  Normal and
    bold weights in a 10-point (6x11) and a 12-point (6x13) size.
    ISO-8859-1 encoding only.

These fonts were created using the xmbdfed BDF font editor
<ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/CLR/multiling/General/>. xmbdfed is not
really around anymore, but you can edit these fonts with
FontForge <https://fontforge.github.io/>.

For more information about fonts and the X Window System, see the X(1)
man page.

| Installing |
+------------+

To use these fonts, you need:

    The X Window System

To install these fonts, you need:

    imake
    make
    bdftopcf
    mkfontdir
    gzip
    tar

Here's how:

    (1) Unpack the tarball containing the jmk-x11-font sources and
        change to the resulting directory.  If you're reading this, you
        already did that, or someone already did it for you.

    (2) Create the Makefile from the Imakefile using imake:
    
            xmkmf

    (3) Compile the BDF fonts to PCF fonts and compress them:
    
            make
            
        If your X Window System supports it, the PCF fonts will be
        compressed using compress (.Z) or gzip (.gz).

    (3a) If you're upgrading from a prior release, move the old `jmk'
         font directory out of the way before installing:
         
            mv FONTDIR/jmk/ FONTDIR/jmk.old/

        (where FONTDIR is the directory under which you installed the
        prior release of these fonts).

    (4) Install the resulting PCF fonts and the fonts.dir and
        fonts.alias files:
        
            make install

        If you would rather install the fonts somewhere besides the
        default location, FONTDIR/jmk/ (where FONTDIR is the root of
        the directory hierarchy where the X Window System fonts are
        installed), you can specify the place to install them on the
        command line:
        
            make install INSTALL_DIR='/insert/your/dir/here'

    (5) Add the directory you installed the fonts into to your font
        path.  You can do this on the fly using (for example):
        
            xset +fp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/jmk

        This adds the directory to the beginning of your font path.  To
        add the directory to the end of your font path, use:
        
            xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/jmk

        Remember to replace `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts' with the
        directory where the X Window System fonts are stored on your
        system (if in doubt, look in the Makefile generated by imake
        for the value of the FONTDIR variable).

        You can add one of the commands above to your ~/.xsession or
        ~/.xinitrc or ~/.Xclients startup file in order to use acces
        the fonts in every X session.

    (6) You can use the font aliases defined in the accompanying
        fonts.alias file for easier specification of these fonts.  For
        example:

            xterm -fn neep-12 -fb neep-bold-12

        Variants of the Neep font are available which have an alternate
	glyph for the ampersand (`&') character; this alternate
	ampersand glyph is more traditionally shaped, and non-US users
	may prefer it.  The alternate fonts are named `Neep Alt'; they
	have aliases beginning with `neep-alt'.  For example:
	
	    rxvt -fn neep-alt-12 -fb neep-alt-bold-12

| Notes |
+-------+

I designed the Imakefile for X11R6.3.  If you have a different version
of X and the Imakefile doesn't work for you, let me know, and perhaps
we can fix it.

Yes, you really need imake.  No, i'm not going to duplicate effort and
maintain a Makefile in addition to an Imakefile.  If you don't have
imake on your system, but you have the X Window System, complain to
your vendor.  If you don't feel like complaining to your vendor,
perhaps you feel like figuring out how to use bdftopcf and mkfontdir.
They each have fine manual pages.  If you don't have manual pages for
them on your system, complain to your vendor loudly.

On Debian-based Linux distributions, imake can be found in the
xutils-dev package.

| History |
+---------+

The Neep (formerly NouveauGothic) family of fonts started out with the
6x13 fonts, because the only decent-looking character cell font that
came with XFree86 was the 7x13 font, and i wanted a font that was
smaller (to make better use of my limited screen real estate) and at
the same time both legible and aesthetically pleasing.  That soon led
to the 6x11 fonts, which i made specifically for my laptop running
Linux and XFree86 at 800x600.  Then, since i had a small and medium
font, large and extra-large ones soon followed to make a relatively
full set.

Since then, i've begun to learn more than i ever really meant to about
the various ISO-8859 8-bit encodings.  I'm all for Unicode myself.
Just say `No' to characters less than 16 bits wide!

 NOTE: I am considering changing the licensing terms of these fonts to
       be more liberal, using either a Perl-style Artistic License or
       an MIT/X-Consortium/Open-Group-style license.  If you have
       something you'd like to say regarding the licensing terms,

Some few parts of these fonts are derived from the 6x13 fixed font
accompanying the XFree86-3.3.2 distribution of the X Window System.
That font bears the notice `Public domain font; share and enjoy'.

The vast majority of this set of fonts is original work.  Besides the
derivations noted above, any resemblance to other fonts, copyrighted or
not, may be accounted for by standard letter shapes and the relatively
coarse resolution (75dpi) for which the fonts were created.
